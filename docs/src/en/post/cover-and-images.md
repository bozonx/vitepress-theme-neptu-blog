The image above is this post's **cover**, set entirely from frontmatter. Below,
the images inside the body open in a **lightbox** — click one to try it.

## External cover

For a remote URL the theme can't measure the file, so you supply
`coverWidth` / `coverHeight` yourself to prevent layout shift.

### How it's done

```yaml
cover: https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1501785888041-...
coverWidth: 1200
coverHeight: 800
coverAlt: Mountain landscape at sunset
coverDescr: "Caption with **markdown** and [links](https://example.com)."
```

## Local cover

Put the file in `src/public/img/` and reference it with a leading `/img/`. The
theme reads the file at build time and fills in the dimensions for you.

```yaml
cover: /img/my-post-cover.jpg
# no coverWidth/coverHeight needed — measured automatically
```

## Body images & the lightbox

Ordinary markdown images anywhere in the body are lazy-loaded and become
clickable — clicking opens a full-screen, zoomable, keyboard-navigable lightbox
(mounted globally by the theme). Try it:

### How it's done

Nothing special — just standard markdown. The lightbox and lazy-loading are on
by default:

```md

```

Use <kbd>Esc</kbd> to close, arrow keys to move between images, and scroll or
double-click to zoom.
