This is the **kitchen-sink** post. Every optional frontmatter field is turned on
so you can see, in one place, how the theme renders each one. Look around: the
cover and its caption are above, the author block, tags, comment link, video
button and podcast dropdown are all wired from the frontmatter.

## What's on this page

| Feature | Field(s) | Where it shows |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cover image + caption | `cover`, `coverWidth/Height`, `coverAlt`, `coverDescr` | top of post |
| Author block | `authorId` | post footer |
| Tags | `tags` | header + footer |
| List preview | `descrAsPreview` | post-list cards |
| Video button | `videoLink`, `videoLinkLang` | top of post |
| Podcast dropdown | `podcasts`, `podcastLang` | top of post |
| Comment link | `commentLink` | post footer |

## How it's done

## Fields that aren't shown here

A few options only make sense in isolation, so they have their own demos:

- `searchIncluded`, `previewText` → [Preview & Search](preview-and-search)
- `canonical`, per-page `seo` toggles → [Canonical & cross-posting](canonical-crosspost)
- `jsonLd` → [JSON-LD](json-ld)
- `translations` → [i18n & hreflang](i18n-hreflang)

## Post body

Everything from here down is ordinary markdown, just to give the post realistic
length in the listings.

```ts
// Code blocks are styled by the theme.
const greet = (name: string) => `Hello, ${name}!`
console.log(greet('world'))
```
