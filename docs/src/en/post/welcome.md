Welcome! This whole site is a **living manual** for
[vitepress-theme-neptu-blog](https://github.com/bozonx/vitepress-theme-neptu-blog).
Instead of separate docs, each post and page here *is* the documentation: you see
a feature rendered, then the exact frontmatter or config that produced it.

## How to read a demo post

Every feature post follows the same shape:

1. The feature, rendered live (this post's cover image above is an example).
2. A **“How it's done”** section with the source you'd copy into your own file.

For instance, the cover image at the top of this post came from:

## How it's done
