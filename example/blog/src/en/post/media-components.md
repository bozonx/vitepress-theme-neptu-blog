The theme registers four media components globally, so you can drop them into any
markdown file without importing anything. Each is rendered live below, followed
by the exact tag that produced it.

## YoutubeVideo

Responsive 16:9 YouTube embed. Pass the video `id` (the part after `?v=`).

<YoutubeVideo id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

### How it's done

```md
<YoutubeVideo id="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />
```

## VideoFile

Inline player for a local/self-hosted video. Native controls: seek, volume,
fullscreen, picture-in-picture.

<VideoFile
  url="/media/sample-video.mp4"
  filename="Big Buck Bunny — sample video (MP4)"
/>

### How it's done

```md
<VideoFile url="/media/sample-video.mp4" filename="Sample video (MP4)" />
```

Place the file in `src/public/media/` and reference it with a leading `/media/`.

## AudioFile

Inline audio player with a download link.

<AudioFile
  url="https://www.w3schools.com/html/horse.mp3"
  filename="Sample audio (horse.mp3)"
/>

### How it's done

```md
<AudioFile url="https://example.com/episode.mp3" filename="Episode 1" />
```

## FileDownload

A styled download button for any file.

<FileDownload
  url="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/wcag21.pdf"
  filename="WCAG 2.1 PDF"
/>

### How it's done

```md
<FileDownload url="https://example.com/archive.zip" filename="Source code" />
```

## Mixing them

You can combine all four in one post — e.g. a tutorial with a `<VideoFile>`
screencast, a related `<YoutubeVideo>` talk, an `<AudioFile>` podcast version,
and a `<FileDownload>` for the sample project.
